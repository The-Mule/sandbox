Summary
=======
In my academic life at Masaryk University I was broadly interested in algorithm engineering with a particular
interest in route-planning algorithms and combinatorics. In my professional life I am a quality assurance
engineer of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. My work is focused on tests automation of components related to
the security and government certifications (FIPS 140 & Common Criteria). I am skilled in Linux system
administration, C/C++ programming and shell scripting. I have working experience with Java, minor
working experience with Python and a moderate understanding of C#, Scala, Go and markup languages.
